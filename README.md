# Hey there, I'm Abhay Kumar 👋

Welcome to my little corner on GitHub!  
I'm a student who's into coding, solving problems, and building useful stuff that makes life easier (or at least more fun 😄).

## 🚧 What I'm Building

- Python projects — apps, automation scripts, and random experiments  
- Tracking my CP (Competitive Programming) practice  
- Trying out small web projects using HTML and slowly diving deeper into web dev

## 📚 What I'm Learning Right Now

- **C++ for Competitive Programming** – building speed and logic with practice  
- Going deeper with Python libraries like Pandas, Tkinter, and maybe Flask  
- Making my SQL stronger and understanding how real-world databases work  
- Looking into how I can include some AI automation in future projects (because… why not?)
